# Git Ignore Hands-on Lab

## Objectives

Understand the concept of `.gitignore`.

Learn how to ignore unwanted files and folders using Git ignore.

Implement `.gitignore` to prevent specific files from being tracked by Git.

---

## Prerequisites

The following are required to complete this lab:

- Git environment setup.
- Notepad++ configured as the default Git editor.
- A local Git repository.
- A remote repository in GitHub/GitLab.

---

# Lab Implementation

## Step 1: Create Git Repository

Create or navigate to the Git working directory.

Example:

```bash
cd GitDemo
```

Initialize Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

---

## Step 2: Create Unwanted Files and Folders

Create a log file:

```bash
echo "Sample log data" > error.log
```

Create a log folder:

```bash
mkdir log
```

The working directory now contains:

```text
GitDemo
│
├── error.log
└── log/
```

---

## Step 3: Create .gitignore File

Create a `.gitignore` file:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Open `.gitignore` and add the following entries:

```text
*.log
log/
```

Explanation:

`*.log` → Ignores all files with `.log` extension.

`log/` → Ignores the log folder and its contents.

---

## Step 4: Check Git Status

Execute:

```bash
git status
```

The `.log` files and `log` folder will not appear as untracked files.

Only files that are not mentioned in `.gitignore` will be displayed.

---

## Step 5: Add and Commit Changes

Add the `.gitignore` file:

```bash
git add .gitignore
```

Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Added gitignore file to ignore log files"
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Ignored Files

Check repository status:

```bash
git status
```

Output:

```text
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This confirms that unwanted files are ignored by Git.

---

## Step 7: Push Changes to Remote Repository

Add remote repository:

```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

Push changes:

```bash
git push origin master
```

# Git Ignore Commands Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git init` | Initializes a Git repository |
| `touch .gitignore` | Creates a gitignore file |
| `git status` | Checks repository status |
| `git add` | Adds files to staging area |
| `git commit` | Saves changes locally |
| `git push` | Uploads changes to remote repository |

---

# Conclusion

This shows how to use `.gitignore` to exclude unwanted files and folders from Git tracking. Log files (`*.log`) and log directories were successfully ignored, and the changes were committed and pushed to the remote repository.
